This is my Google homepage replica.

It is my fourth html project and I like the way it turned out! I decided
not to place a blue sign in button. I focused mainly on the logo, search bar,
and search buttons.

The navigation also took a bit of work to figure out but I believe it is pretty
close to the source material. I hope you enjoy!
